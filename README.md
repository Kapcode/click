Click is command line auto clicker with a built in safety mode to prevent user error causing complete lockups. It is very versatile, with many options to get the desired behavior.  

OPTIONS
*all time is measured in milliseconds.

-startDelay TIME  = time to wait before starting first click

-every TIME  = specify time between clicks , makes click run in a loop. The time waited at the end of each click is: ( (-every) -  (-hold) )  +  (-afterClickDelay)

-hold TIME = time to wait before releasing after pressing

-afterClickDelay TIME  =  time to wait after each click. Is not effected by -every or -hold

-duration TIME  = amount of time to wait after first click before termination 

-location X,Y  = location to move cursor to before each click ( this can make it impossible to move cursor to safety location(s) )

-count NUMBER  =  how many times to click before termination.

-button 1-3  = buttons 1,2,3 or l,m,r or left,middle,right

-press  TRUE | FALSE = press mouse button each time if true, not if false

-release TRUE | FALSE  =   release mouse button each time if true, not if false(script will always release before exiting, unless user kills task outside of click program)




-safety  =   defaults are 0,0,Meta …. defaults are used if -safety tag is not used
*Meta is the Windows Key, or Mac Command Key.

	       Examples | Explanations:

-safety 0,0,Meta 	| stop if cursor ever goes to 0,0 or if user presses Meta

-safety alt		| stop if user presses alt

-safety 1920,1080	| stop if cursor ever goes to cords… bottom right of a 1080p screen 
(might not be reachable depending on OS behavior with edges of screen)

-safety alt,ctrl,0,0,alt	| stop if alt is pressed, stop if ctrl is pressed, stop if cursor goes to 0,0 ,stop if F1 is pressed. Multiple keys are not shortcuts… they are extra safety keys. Its a safety, not a hotkey!

-safety is made to prevent a user from locking up there computer to the point they would have to power it off with the power button. They can meet the safety condition(s) to terminate the process.

-safety off   or   -safety false  will turn it off complete.  Only do this if you know exactly what you are doing!

USAGE:
click -every 200 -duration 10000 -button 2
(click every 200 mills , terminate after 10 seconds, use mouse button 2/middle click)

click -every 200 -count 50 -startDelay 5000 -safety a,s,d,f,0,0
(click every 200 mills, terminate after 50 clicks, terminate if user presses any of the specified keys, terminate if cursor moves to 0,0)

click -release false -hold 5000
(press mouse button once, do not release, hold for 5 seconds,  exit, exit always releases mouse button.)


*Note
On Linux, avoid calling java “-jar path/to/click.jar -every 100”
and instead call “click -every 100” with the following command:
alias click='java -jar /path/to/click.jar'
